/*
                 ADVANTAGE/DISADVANTAGE LINKED LIST:

  ADVANTAGE: It helps to no need to keep track of positions of data units.
            and it is easier to insert and delete from the back and the end.

  DISADVANTAGE: It is not easy to shuffle and change the content of its elements compared to array.
      It is hard to traverse backward and one cannot have access ti a specific element

                    ADVANTAGE/DISADVANTAGE ARRAY:

  ADVANTAGE: It is easy to manipulate the content of array elements and one can have access
               to every specific index/element without traversal.

  DISADVANTAGE: It is not as easy to resize as compared to linked list.
