To use this code in the camera assignment include these hooks. I put them  right below where I made the canvas hook.
<div id="imageIDs"></div>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./keyboardKeyDisplay/imageDisplay.css">
<script src="keyboardKeyDisplay/key_printer.js"></script>

You must also include the folder with all the images and with the key_printer.js file and the imageDisplay.css file.
References to where the images were found are here.
